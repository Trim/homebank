    <h1>Euro minor</h1>
    <p>For countries in the European area, or those using the Euro currency (EUR), HomeBank deliver some extra features to display to Euro major/minor, and also to convert if necessary. This covers the 2 situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>in waiting a future switch to euro currency, euro is then minor, and your national currency is major</li>
      <li>after a switch to euro currency, euro is then major, and your national currency is minor</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="rounded content">
      <h2>Display in Euro currency</h2>
      <p>Setting up the minor currency properties is done in the <a href="dlg-pref.html#tab9">Preference dialog</a>.</p>
      <p>Once the settings are correctly set you can switch most of the displays to minor currency, minor can be Euro if your country is waiting a switch to euro, or the old former national currency if your country already switched to euro.</p>
      <p>When the minor currency is activated, a minor toggle menu will appear in most windows.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rounded content">
      <h2>Convert to Euro currency</h2>
      <p>From the account window, menu Tools/'Convert to euro', you are able to convert an entire account to the euro currency, according the settings you configured into the preferences.</p>
      <p>This could also be used one day in the hypothesis a country will switch back to a national currency from euro currency, the rate configured in the euro preferences just need to be correct.</p>
