    <h1>Euro minor</h1>

<p>For countries in the European area, or those using the Euro currency (EUR), HomeBank deliver some
extra features to display to Euro major/minor, and also to convert if necessary. This covers the 2 situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>in waiting a future swith to euro currency, euro is then minor, and your national currency is major
<li>after a switch to euro currency, euro is then major, and your national currency is minor
</ul>


  <div class="rounded content">

  <h2>Display in Euro currency</h2>

  <p>Setting up the minor currency properties is done in the <a href=
  "dlg-pref.html#tab7">Preference dialog</a>.</p>

  <p> Once the settings are correctly set you can switch most of the displays to minor
  currency, minor can be Euro if your country is waiting a swith to euro, or the old former
  national currency if your contry already switched to euro.

  <p>When the minor currency is activated, a minor toggle menu will appear
  in most windows.</p>

  <div class="rounded content">

  <h2>Convert to Euro currency</h2>

  <p>From the account window, menu Tools/'Convert to euro', you are able to convert an entire account
to the euro currency, according the settings you configured into the preferences.</p>

<p> This could also be used one day in the hypothesis a country will switch back to a national 
currency from euro currency, the rate configured in the euro preferences just need to be correct.</p>
