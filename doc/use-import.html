  <div class="rounded content">

  <h3 id="step3">Step 3: Adjust what to import</h3>

  <p>The following steps will only be displayed when you need to validate or confirm 
  an action or a configuration.</p>

  <h4>File properties</h4>
  <p>This step is never showed, until you use the back button, as HomeBank will go to the step you need to change or check things</p>

  <img class="gtkshot left" src="images/use-import3.png">

  <p>A summary of the file currently in the import process is showed 
  with a count of accounts, transactions, payees and categories.</p>
  
  <p>When you import a QIF/CSV file, HomeBank will try to import date with the format order configured into the preferences, 
  and it will try to detect it otherwise. If something went wrong with the date, please adjust the preferences settings to match 
  the file date format order you usually import.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>


  <h4>Account to import</h4>
  <img class="gtkshot left" src="images/use-import4.png">

  <p>Here you will control the accounts and how to import it.</p>

  <p>Depending on the file format, HomeBank will try to match the account by its number or its name.</p>
  
  <p>For QIF: the match will be done by the account name</p>
  <p>For OFX: by account number, HomeBank try to find the OFX number as a substring of an account number.</p>
  <p>For CSV: a default account will be created.</p>
  
  <P>However, for some QIF files, or any CSV files, there is no information that will permit to identify the 
  account to import, so you will need to manage this manually.</p>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <h4>Transactions to import</h4>

  <img class="gtkshot left" src="images/use-import5.png">

  <p>Here you will control the transactions to be imported.</p>

  <p>HomeBank will detect if a transaction in the current import file
  already exists into the target account, and if so will disable it for import and show
  a warning icon.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Detail of existing transaction</strong> section will show the transaction suspected to 
  already exists and them let you choose what to do.</p>

  <p>You can also change the detection parameters and refresh that list.</p>

  <p>The detection of existing transaction is done in the following order, according 
  to the date tolerance (default is 0 days).</p>
	<ul>
	<li>same account
	<li>same amount
	<li>same date (with the configured tolerance)
	</ul>
