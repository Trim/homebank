    <h1>Reconcile</h1>

  <p>The reconcile, or verification of transactions using your bank
  statement is done manually in HomeBank.</p>

  <div class="rounded content">

  <h2>How the reconcile should be done ?</h2>

  <p>To start, your bank balance must be the last reconcile that you did
  with the previous bank statement.</p>

  <p>Then you will validate each transaction and normally you have the bank
  balance of HomeBank which correspond to the one of your statement.</p>
</div>

  <div class="rounded content">

  <h2>What to do if the balance are not equals ?</h2>

  <p>If balances are not equal at the end of the reconcile, measure the
  gap. Then transactions have changed are identified through the small icon
  which indicates they have been edited.</p>

  <p>Though you do not see visually, the filter may help.</p>

  <p>Finally, it is sometimes easier to go back and start reconcile at the
  beginning.</p>
